This is the main screen where seekers manage or explore tasks.

Each card displays:

Task title, short description, budget (if paid), and location.

Pending:

Tasks the seeker has already accepted and is currently working on.

Each card shows progress/status, due date, etc.

Tap → opens Task Details (read-only).

No editing options — seeker only views and updates progress through system-defined actions if allowed (like “Mark as Done”).

Completed:

Shows all tasks seeker has completed.

Each card can show completion date and earned rating/review.

Tap → opens details and feedback summary.

2️⃣ Notifications Tab

3️⃣ My Profile Tab

This is where the seeker manages their personal data.

Sections / UI elements:

Profile Card: profile picture, name, short bio.

Location selector: choose or update location (used for task matching).

Ratings & Reviews:

Average rating (e.g., ⭐ 4.8 / 5)

List of reviews from Posters.

💡 Flow Summary

The seeker can only view tasks (never edit them).

The main focus is browsing, tracking, and reputation.

Navigation stays minimal and aligned with mobile UX patterns.

Would you like me to now make a wireframe or UML diagram of this seeker flow (with Tasks → Pending/New/Completed and Profile structure)?
It’ll show visually how screens link together.
